# Oh Hail No! Predicting Severe Hailstorms for Effective Emergency Preparedness

![image](figures/title-header.png)

This repository documents our final project for the Big Data and Cloud Computing course where we were tasked to perform machine learning via distributed cloud computing on a 50 GB dataset. We also presented our project in a [public presentation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamwong1_excited-to-share-a-major-milestone-in-activity-7090189238427664384-NHgw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) at the Asian Institute of Management. 

## Overview
- Addressing challenges in severe weather forecasting and hailstorm prediction to enhance human safety and property protection in severe weather events.
- Utilization of extensive weather data from the [NOAA Severe Weather Data Inventory](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-swdi/) on Registry of Open Data on AWS.
- Data processing using Apache Spark and data formatting in Parquet for efficiency and scalability.
- Machine learning with the Random Forest Regressor, predicting severe hailstorms using spatial and temporal features, Vertically Integrated Liquid (VIL), and cloud height.
- Model evaluation to identify key predictive features and insights into hailstorm behavior.
